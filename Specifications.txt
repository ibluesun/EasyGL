This is My EasyGL  Engine
built on top of OpenGL
trying to make Drawing 3d is much easier

this version is compiled under the C++.NET   but  not its Frame work

So
After thinking i discovered that making Engine is good
but making 3d is Marvlous
until now all code is aimed to engine 
so i come up with 2nd idea

building SHELL  :)

this SHELL will be accessed by variety of languages

like PERL & .net languages

SHELL  will be Heaviely toward 3d itself

and OPERATING SYSTEM CALLS  still in EasyGL
